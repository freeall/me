# Commandline tools

These are tools I've created I thought would be worth to mention

## [create-repository](https://github.com/freeall/create-repository)

![create-repository](/create-repository.png)
Creates a github repository from the command line. Either pass `--name` and `--description` or it reads a `package.json` file in currect folder.

## [dependency-hunter](https://github.com/freeall/dependency-hunter)

Finds node.js dependencies in yours (or your organizations) github repositories.

Quite often in bigger projects you have a github organization where you put all your repositories. But as it scales up it becomes more difficult to get an overview of which modules/apps/projects have a dependency to other modules. This tool make it easier to get that overview.
